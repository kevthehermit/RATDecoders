RATDecoders
===========

This Repo will hold a collection of Python Scripts that will extract and decode the configuration settings from common rats.

Each of these decoders is running on http://malwareconfig.com and has additional features that are not included in the scripts.

If you wish to contribute please feel free to fork or email me on decoders@malwareconfig.com
